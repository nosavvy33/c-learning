Basic C program

#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
	printf("Hello, World!\n");
	return 0;
}


Preprocessor:

	#include <stdio.h> is part of the pre-processor. At this very point, the code is not compile yet.
	Before compiling, the preprocessor gives instructions as of what libs (that is another file) have to be included in the program
	in order to compile with their required features.
	Preprocessing commands (aka Directives) always start with #

Directives: 

	A directive is a preprocessor command used as a header of a C program.
	They are useful for alot whole number of things, that go from defining static variables to functions
	
	#define this command writes or overwrites constants or so called Macros

	Ex:
		#include <stdio.h>
		#ifndef MESSAGE
			#define MESSAGE "Hello from the header section"
		#endif

		 int main(){
		printf(MESSAGE);
		return 0;
		}
